# Simple JS calendar
A simple calendar inspired by to-do lists to show basic concepts of programming in JavaScript.

## Covered JS concepts
* classes, objects and inheritance
* functions and encapsulation
* arrow function
* ternary operator
* let and const variables
* array ES6 methods
* spread operator
* adding and mutating DOM elements
* form handling 
* event bubbling
* Progressive Web App

## Try it yourself - ideas to expand the app
* add a new event type
* add event time
* add some card and form animations
* do not display events which have passed
* use localStorage to save events

## How to run PWA locally
For PWA to work locally you need a local server with https, for example local-web-server.

Install the server globally:
`npm i -g local-web-server`  
Run the app with https: `lws --https`

The app will run at https://127.0.0.1:8000
